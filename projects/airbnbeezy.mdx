## Introduction

Airbnbeezy is a remarkable web application that mirrors the core functionalities of Airbnb, a prominent online marketplace for lodging and travel experiences. Crafted meticulously by a solo developer (myself), this project encompasses a testament to my expertise in software engineering and full-stack web development.

By leveraging a tech stack comprising React, Redux, Express, and Sequelize, Airbnbeezy brings to life a platform that enables users to discover accommodations, make bookings, leave reviews, and enjoy a seamless travel planning experience. The integration of AWS S3 for image uploads, Google Maps API for location services, and user authentication further elevates the application's utility and user-friendliness.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives that steered the development of Airbnbeezy are outlined below:

1. <span class="text-pink-500">Functionality replication</span>: The foremost
   goal was to replicate Airbnb's core features, enabling users to search for
   accommodations, view detailed listings, make bookings, and post reviews.
2. <span class="text-pink-500">Database design</span>: The design and
   implementation of a robust and efficient database schema using Sequelize
   aimed to ensure optimal storage and retrieval of user, property, booking, and
   review data. The very first version of this schema is shown below.
3. <span class="text-pink-500">User‑centric UI design</span>: The user interface
   (UI) design focused on creating an intuitive, visually pleasing, and
   responsive layout to provide a delightful user experience.
4. <span class="text-pink-500">Secure user authentication</span>: Implementing a
   secure user authentication and authorization system to safeguard user data
   and provide controlled access to application features.
5. <span class="text-pink-500">Seamless image uploads (AWS S3)</span>: The
   integration of AWS S3 for image uploads guarantees a smooth process of
   uploading, storing, and displaying property images.
6. <span class="text-pink-500">Streamlined booking process</span>: Developing a
   simplified and efficient booking process for users to easily select dates,
   make payments, and receive booking confirmations.
7. <span class="text-pink-500">Empowering user reviews</span>: Enabling users to
   leave reviews for properties, fostering transparency and aiding other users
   in making informed decisions.
8. <span class="text-pink-500">Location services (Google Maps API)</span>:
   Leveraging the Google Maps API to provide accurate property locations and
   assist users in understanding the surrounding area.

## Tech Stack

The technological choices underpinning Airbnbeezy's development are a testament to creating a robust and efficient application:

  <span class="text-pink-500">Express</span>, a minimalist Node.js web
  application framework, facilitated routing, server setup, and API development.
- <span class="text-pink-500">Database</span>: <span class="text-pink-500">
    Sequelize
  </span>, a promise-based Node.js ORM, enabled interactions with the MySQL database,
  ensuring data integrity and efficiency.
- <span class="text-pink-500">User authentication</span>:
  <span class="text-pink-500">JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</span> were employed to secure
  user authenticaiton and manage user sessions.
- **Image uploads (AWS S3):** The integration with <span className="text-pink-500">
  AWS S3
  </span> allowed for efficient and secure storage of property images.
- **Location services (Google Maps API):** Integration with the <span className="text-pink-500">
  Google Maps API
  </span> provided accurate and interactive property locations.
