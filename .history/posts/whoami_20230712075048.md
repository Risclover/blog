preview: In today's fast-paced online community landscape, real-time interaction has become the lifeblood of user engagement. As the creator and developer of Ribbit, a comprehensive and pixel-perfect replica of Reddit, I knew that the app couldn't be complete until I had at least captured the captivating experience of live communication offered by the popular platform. My long-standing ambition of integrating a live chat feature within Ribbit finally came to fruition just last week, and I am excited to break down and discuss this process in detail. Join me as we take a deep dive into the code that powers Ribbit's live chat feature and discuss the project in its entirety, from the initial planning stages all the way to its completion.
